# Biography

<img src="./img/ID.png" align="right" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
I am a Senior Lecturer and a Chief Investigator with QUT Centre for Robotics (QCR), where I co-lead the visual learning and understanding program. I served as a Chief Investigator of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision (concluded in 2020). My research focuses on enabling the reliable deployment of computer vision and machine learning on mobile robots in real-world environments. I have extensive experience in applied robotic vision research resulting from my work on exciting projects such as AGRobotic detection of weed in farms using deep learning, vision-enabled autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) to protect the Great Barrier Reef from Crown-of-Thorns Starfish and vision-based infrastructure inspection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). I am also a lecturer in advanced robotics topics for undergraduates, where I teach Bayesian approaches to robot localisation, mapping, and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM).
