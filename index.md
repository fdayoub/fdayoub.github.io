# Welcome

<img src="./img/ID.png" align="right" alt="drawing" width="100"/>
I am a Senior Lecturer (equivalent to Associate Professor in the Nth American system) with the School of Computer Science and the Australian Institute for Machine Learning [(AIML)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/) at the University of Adelaide. I am also an Associate Investigator with QUT Centre for Robotics (QCR). I served as a Chief Investigator of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Robotic Vision](http://www.roboticvision.org/annualreport2020/) (concluded in 2020). My research focuses on enabling the reliable deployment of computer vision and machine learning on mobile robots in real-world environments. My broad research interests focus on themes such as Autonomous Robots Perception Systems Monitoring, Uncertainty Handling and Open-Set Recognition in Object Detection, Precision Agriculture, Place Recognition and Semantic Mapping. I have extensive experience in applied robotic vision research resulting from my work on exciting projects such as AGRobotic detection of weed in farms using deep learning, vision-enabled autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) to protect the Great Barrier Reef from Crown-of-Thorns Starfish and vision-based infrastructure inspection using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). I've also lectured on advanced computer vision and robotics topics for undergraduates, where I taught Bayesian approaches to robot localisation, mapping, and Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM).
